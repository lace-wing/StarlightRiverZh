	}

	NpcBestiary: {
		Dweller: They have evolved to camoflauge themselves as trees, and use this ability to ambush unsuspecting victims in comical fashion. The laugh just sells the point.
		SoulNibbler: These tiny pests take after their larger bretheren, floating eerily and swarming any foolish enough to come near their tiny, but awfully sharp, fangs.
		CrescentCaster: As the first in a long line of dead wizards, this one has had ample time to practice magic. Using its crescent staff, this fiend generates Barrier for all nearby foes - but is immobile while doing so.
		Warbanner: An artifact from battles past, this cursed sign still inspires others with the enraging spirit of battle to this day.
		Blover: Blovers are clover-based plants that harness the ambient mana during particularly windy days to spin their fan-shaped leaves at approaching creatures. They are immobile, and would serve as a good form of defense if one were to discover a way to move or perhaps plant one.
		Fogbinder: They call it... The fogbinder. Appearing during thunderstorms, this being is very Spooky, Demented, Demonic, Hellish, and Evil.
		LootWraith: The tortured souls of adventurers obsessed with treasure, forever cursed in death to protect the only thing they cared about in life
		Dreamprism: These anomalous beings are a collection of previously lifeless rocks possessed by the hopes and dreams of the collective subconscious.
		AngryCrescent: A chunk of the moon possessed with hatred for you. These creatures will stop at nothing to protect their home.
		Snoobel: A curious but cruel creature, the snoobel wanders the frozen caverns, using its trunk as an instrument of absolute death.
		GloomSlime: These drab dribbling droplets descend devilishly after dusk, deep in the depths of doom.
		CrystalSlime: An extremely elusive specimen. It's taken in a large amount of crystals and Starlight energy, forming a priceless coating over its membrane. Anyone that finds an intact one should be extremely careful not to break it, for it's likely they will never encounter it again.
		DesertWisp: A tangle of Starlight energy that can be considered alive, if only barely.
		KettleCreature: A construct built by an unknown people, seemingly harvesting crystal and processing it internally. It can be assumed that it has run out of storage after an extremely long amount of time unmaintained, so it uses its excess molten crystal as an automatic defense mechanism.
		MagmitePassive: A barely-sentient bundle of magma, closely related to slimes. Harbors absolutely zero animosity towards anything ever, and would get along well with just about any creature if it weren't for its body being thousands of degrees hotter than they would prefer.
		MagmiteSmol: A tiny sentient drop of magma freshly born from the pools of molten glass. Harbors endless curiosity towards everything and everyone it comes across, but it doesn't yet realize that its body is hundreds of degrees hotter than most living things can bear.
		MagmiteLarge: A matured magmite, covered with intricate patterns and swirls from the slow cooling of its body. Most creatures dare not approach to admire its magnificence, as it still still brilliantly burns thousands of degrees.
		Snake: A territorial species found nesting in the sands of the Vitric Desert. Approach with caution - they are passive only until one encroaches upon their territory.
		BoomBug: A swarming insect found in the Vitric Desert. Rapidly calls forth its lesser bretheren as a means of attack, flying close to their target before detonating their molten nectar to burn and cook their prey
		LesserFirebug: A lesser form of the Firebug, these are at the bottom of the nest's heirarchy. They are regularly sent to their deaths in order to detonate their own bodys to help the hive hunt.
		CoolmitePassive: Through the power of Shimmer, this form of Magmite has magically cooled down to safe temperatures without rendering itself immobile. Unfortunately, this is a rather chilly temperature for a creature used to being submerged in lava, so they go to great lengths to heat themselves back up.
		CoolmiteSmol: Through the power of Shimmer, this form of Magmite has been cooled into a crystalized shard of sentient magma. Even though this leaves the magmite harmless to other creatures, this rigid form actually hinders its endless curiosity as it can no longer fit itself into small spaces.
		CoolmiteLarge: Even through the power of Shimmer, this form of Magmite is so hot that its heat is partially retained. Although its rotund crystal body remains mesmerizing to all that behold it, it seems quite perturbed that it has lost its magnificent swirls.
		CrystalPopper: A territorial bat, related to the Sandviper. It launches itself into the air when startled, accompanied with a burst of its nesting crystals towards any nearby foes.
		GruntConstruct: One of the Glassweaver's constructs. Uses its small stature and curved blade to menace challengers up close.
		JuggernautConstruct: One of the Glassweaver's constructs. This sturdy brute will often use its allies as projectiles when out of smashing range.
		PelterConstruct: One of the Glassweaver's constructs. Relatively fragile, it draws intricate arrows from its own molten body.
		ShieldConstruct: One of the Glassweaver's constructs. Once its spiked shield is dug into the ground, this stalwart protector is immovable.
		SupporterConstruct: One of the Glassweaver's constructs. Channels its power to strengthen its allies' glass bodies. This may result in a power surge.
		FlyingGruntConstruct: One of the Glassweaver's constructs. An already formidable duelist, made airborne - speed is war.
		FlyingPelterConstruct: One of the Glassweaver's constructs. Shares its ground variant's fragility, but it's wings grant it unparalleled vantage.
